# HLTB for Steam

A [Millennium](https://steambrew.app/) plugin that displays [How Long To Beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/) completion times on game pages in the Steam library.

![Big Picture Mode](example_bigPictureMode.png)

## Features

- Shows HLTB completion times directly on game pages:
  - Main Story
  - Main + Extras
  - Completionist
- Works in both Desktop and Big Picture modes
- Caches results locally, optionally clear via the settings page
- Click "View Details" to open the full HLTB page

## Requirements

- [Millennium](https://steambrew.app/) installed on Steam
- Windows or Linux

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Millennium installed on your Steam client
2. Navigate to HLTB from the [plugins page](https://steambrew.app/plugins)
3. Click the "Copy Plugin ID" button
4. Back in Steam, go to Steam menu > Millenium > Plugins > Install a plugin and paste the code
5. Follow the remaining instructions to install and enable the plugin

## Usage

Once installed, HLTB data automatically appears on game pages in your Steam library. Simply click on any game to see its completion times displayed on the header image.

## How It Works

1. When you view a game page, the plugin detects the Steam App ID
2. The Lua backend queries the Steam API to get the game name
3. It searches How Long To Beat for matching games
4. Results are cached locally and displayed on the game header

There is a settings page where you can view the current cache stats or clear the cache, mainly useful for testing.

HLTB uses name based search, and often times the name in HLTB does not match Steam. Most of the time it just works. Occasionally it does not, and so there is a [name fixes](./backend/name_fixes.lua) file. Some internal name simplification is done to handle frequent issues, but there are still some edge cases. Feel free to submit a PR for any additional name fixes.

## Known Limitations

- Games not in the HLTB database will show placeholder dashes
- Some games may not match correctly due to name differences between Steam and HLTB
- DLC and non-game content will not have HLTB data

## Development

See the [development docs](./docs/README.md).
